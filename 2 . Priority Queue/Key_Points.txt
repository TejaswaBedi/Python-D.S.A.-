i -> parent

left-child = 2*i+1
right -child = 2*i+2

parent :

parent = (left-child-1)/2
parent = (right-child-1)/2

Comlexity :

Insertion -> 
Time = O(log N)
Space = O(1)

Deletion ->
Time = O(log N)
Space = O(log N) because of recursion process storage is used

In Finding or limiting a problem upto a value of K then in finding :
Maximum -> MinHeap is used
Minimum -> MaxHeap is used
